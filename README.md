## Building for Testing
First of all you need [Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/). After that, download the source code or clone the project. After all is done run this command in the root folder:
- `npm install`
- `npm run build`

This will create a `dist` folder for you to install in `about:debugging`
